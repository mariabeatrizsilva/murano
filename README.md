<h1>Welcome to my Murano Glass Cup renderer! </h1>

<h2> The project! </h2>
 I created this project as a final project for my Computer Graphics class at NYU. 
 Using WebGL, I modeled a set of Murano glass cups I own. Click the link below to check out the project <br> <center> <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~ms14127/GRAPHICS/murano/index.html"><img alt="muranoproj" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/murano-project-blue?style=flat"></a> </center>

<h2> Adding your own flare</h2>
All of the code to modify the cups is contained in <code>basecup.js</code>. To create your own texture, scroll down to the fragment shader and create your own function that will make the texture. Then, in the <code>cup_text</code> function, return the texture you created.
